the approach is simple and

The ancestor mean the parent or grand parent of the nodes is the

given p and q 

if root.val == p || root.val == q
    then either p or q will be the ancestor of the nodes 

else

    serach for the p and q in left and right

    if (p || q)  found in left  and the right(p || q  ) found in right
        then root will be the ancestor of the nodes
    if left == null then ans will be the right of the
    if right == null then ans will be the left of

//Minimize the Heights II  
 approcah
 we have find the minium difference between the min and max
so  first we need to sort the array to get the initial differce 
that is 
int arr[]; arr lenght=n
// after sorting the array 
max=arr[n-1];
min=arr[0];
res=max-min;
// after
now we need to keep track of the min and max while iterating the arry by adding the given k value to the current element
[ 1, 5 ,8,10 ]

as the min is initialy the arr[0];
and the max is initialy the arr[n-1];
 
// finding the updated min
    it will in the range of i in 1 to n-1;

// finding the max 
    it will in the range of i 0 to n-2;


that is 
if(arr[i]>=k) then 
// update the min and max

min is minof(arr[i]-k,arr[0]+k);
max is maxof(arr[i-1]+k,arr[n-1]-k);
after we get the min and max update
we chech for the result 
res=min(res,max-min);

else we continue not to update the result;
